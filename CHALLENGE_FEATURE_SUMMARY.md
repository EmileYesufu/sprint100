## 🗄️ Database Migration:

Migration created: `20251007133415_add_username_to_user`

```sql
ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE;
```

**Run migration:**
```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate dev
```

**Or reset database:**
```bash
cd server
rm prisma/dev.db
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

### 1. Start the Server:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start the Client (rebuild required):
```bash
cd client

# Rebuild for AsyncStorage + username changes
# In Xcode: Cmd+Shift+K, then Cmd+R
```

### 3. Test Flow:

**Register with username:**
1. Open app → Register
2. Enter email, username (e.g., "player1"), password
3. Submit → Should create account with username

**Challenge another user:**
1. Have 2 test accounts registered
2. Login as User A
3. Go to Online tab → Switch to "Challenge" mode
4. Search for User B's username
5. Tap "Challenge" button
6. User B sees incoming challenge
7. User B taps "Accept"
8. Both navigate to race screen
9. Race proceeds normally with Elo changes

**Quick Match still works:**
1. Switch to "Quick Match" mode
2. Join Queue
3. Wait for opponent
4. Normal matchmaking flow unchanged

---

## ✅ Validation & Safety:

- ✅ Username uniqueness enforced by database
- ✅ Cannot challenge yourself
- ✅ Cannot challenge offline users
- ✅ Duplicate challenges prevented
- ✅ Challenges cleaned up on disconnect
- ✅ Existing queue/matchmaking unchanged
- ✅ ELO system unchanged
- ✅ Training mode unaffected
- ✅ All TypeScript types updated

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Features:

- Username displayed as `@username` in profile
- Mode switcher with clear active state
- Search box with inline search button
- Challenge button in orange (distinct from queue green)
- Incoming challenges highlighted in blue
- Accept (green) / Decline (red) buttons
- Alerts for success/error feedback

---

## 🔧 Architecture Notes:

### Challenge Flow:
```
User A searches "player2"
→ GET /api/users/search?q=player2
→ Results show User B
→ User A clicks "Challenge"
→ emit send_challenge({targetUsername: "player2"})
→ Server finds User B's socketId
→ Server stores challenge in Map
→ emit challenge_received to User B
→ User B sees incoming challenge
→ User B clicks "Accept"
→ emit accept_challenge({fromId: A.id})
→ Server creates match (same as queue)
→ emit match_start to both players
→ Race begins
```

### Data Stores (in-memory):
- `queue[]` - Players waiting for quick match
- `userSockets` - Map<userId, socketId> for routing
- `challenges` - Map<"fromId-toId", ChallengeData>
- `matches` - Map<matchId, MatchState>

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements:

- Challenge expiration (auto-remove after 60s)
- Challenge history/stats
- Friend system
- Block/ignore users
- Rematch after challenge games
- Challenge accept push notifications

---

## 📝 Breaking Changes:

**Existing users will NOT work** until they have usernames. For production:
1. Add migration to backfill usernames for existing users
2. Or require users to set username on first login

For development:
- Database was reset with fresh schema
- All users must re-register with username
