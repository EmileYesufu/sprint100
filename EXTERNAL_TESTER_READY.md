## ðŸ“± For Your External Tester

**Send them this message:**

```
Hi! The Sprint100 app is ready to test.

1. Install "Expo Go" from the App Store

2. I'll send you a QR code - scan it with Expo Go
   (Use the "Scan QR code" button inside Expo Go app)

3. Wait 30 seconds for the app to load (first time only)

4. Try signing up with:
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Username: yourusername
