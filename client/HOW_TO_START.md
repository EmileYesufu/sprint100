## Important Notes

**WiFi Required:**
- Your iPhone must be on the **same WiFi** as your Mac
- Check both devices are on the same network

**First Load:**
- Takes 20-30 seconds (bundling code)
- This is normal!
- Second load: 2-3 seconds

## Alternative: Tunnel Mode

If same WiFi doesn't work, use tunnel mode:

```

This works even if devices are on different networks!
