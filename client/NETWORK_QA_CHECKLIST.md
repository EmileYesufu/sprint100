**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Automatic refresh 5 minutes before expiration
- [ ] No user interruption during refresh
- [ ] New token stored securely
- [ ] App continues functioning normally

### Test 6: Token Refresh Failure
**Objective**: Test behavior when token refresh fails

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Login with user account
2. [ ] Simulate server error (disable server)
3. [ ] Wait for token expiration
4. [ ] Observe refresh failure
5. [ ] Verify logout and redirect to login

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Refresh attempt fails gracefully
- [ ] User is logged out automatically
- [ ] Redirect to login screen
- [ ] Clear error messaging
- [ ] No app crashes

### Test 7: Expired Token on App Start
**Objective**: Test handling of expired token on app launch

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Login and get token
2. [ ] Manually expire token (or wait for expiration)
3. [ ] Close and restart app
4. [ ] Observe token validation on startup
5. [ ] Verify refresh attempt or logout

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] App detects expired token on startup
- [ ] Automatic refresh attempt
- [ ] Fallback to logout if refresh fails
- [ ] Smooth transition to login screen

## üö® **Error Boundary Testing**

### Test 8: JavaScript Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify ErrorBoundary catches and handles errors

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Enable development mode
2. [ ] Trigger JavaScript error (force crash)
3. [ ] Observe ErrorBoundary fallback UI
4. [ ] Test "Restart App" functionality
5. [ ] Verify error details in development

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ErrorBoundary catches the error
- [ ] Friendly error message displayed
- [ ] "Restart App" button functional
- [ ] Error details shown in development
- [ ] No app crashes to system

### Test 9: Network Error Recovery
**Objective**: Test error recovery during network issues

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Start race with poor network connection
