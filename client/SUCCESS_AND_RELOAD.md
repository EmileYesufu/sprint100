# 🎉 SUCCESS! Your App is Running!

## ✅ What Just Happened

**Great news!** Your Xcode build succeeded and the app launched in the simulator! 🎉

The error you're seeing is just because the Metro bundler (JavaScript packager) wasn't running yet.

**I've just started Metro in the background.**

---

## 🔄 Reload the App Now

### Option 1: Reload in Simulator (Easiest)

In the **iOS Simulator**:

1. Press `Cmd + D` (opens dev menu)
2. Tap **"Reload"**

Or simply:
- Press `Cmd + R` in the simulator

The app should now load with content!

### Option 2: Rebuild from Xcode

In **Xcode**:
- Press `Cmd + R` (Build and Run again)
- The app will reload with Metro running

---

## ✅ What You Should See After Reload

1. ✅ App loads without errors
2. ✅ **Login/Register screen** appears
3. ✅ Email and password input fields
4. ✅ Login and Register buttons
5. ✅ Styled UI (not just wireframe)

---

## 📺 Check Your Terminal

You should see Metro bundler output like:

```
Starting Metro Bundler
Waiting on http://localhost:8081
Logs for your project will appear below

› Press ? │ show all commands
```

This means Metro is running and serving the JavaScript code.

## 🧪 Test the App

Once the app reloads with content:

### 1. Register a New Account

1. Tap **"Register"**
2. Enter email: `test@example.com`
3. Enter password: `password123`
4. Tap **"Register"** button

**Important:** Make sure the server is running!

```bash
# Open a NEW terminal window and run:
cd /Users/emile/sprint100-1/server
npm run dev
```

### 2. After Registration/Login

You should see:
- ✅ Bottom tab bar with: Race, Profile, Leaderboard, Settings
- ✅ Race tab shows "Join Queue" button
- ✅ Profile shows your email and Elo
- ✅ Full app is functional!

## 🐛 If Reload Doesn't Work

### Metro Not Running?

Check your terminal. If you don't see Metro output:

```bash
cd /Users/emile/sprint100-1/client
npx expo start
```

Leave this terminal window open.

### Still Showing Wireframe?

1. **Stop the app** in simulator (double-click home, swipe up)
2. **Quit Xcode** (`Cmd + Q`)
3. **Restart Metro:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/emile/sprint100-1/client
   npx expo start
   ```
4. **Rebuild in Xcode** (`Cmd + R`)

### Error: "Unable to connect to Metro"

The app is trying localhost:8081. Verify:

```bash
# Check if Metro is running on 8081
lsof -ti:8081
```

If nothing shows, Metro isn't running. Start it:
```bash
npx expo start
```

## 📋 Development Workflow Going Forward

### Daily Development:

**Terminal 1 - Metro Bundler:**
```bash
cd /Users/emile/sprint100-1/client
npx expo start
```
**Keep this running!** This serves your JavaScript code.

**Terminal 2 - Server:**
```bash
cd /Users/emile/sprint100-1/server
npm run dev
```
**Keep this running!** This handles authentication and game logic.

**Xcode:**
- Only rebuild when you change native code or add dependencies
- Otherwise, just save files and use Fast Refresh
