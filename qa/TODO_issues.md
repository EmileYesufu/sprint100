# Sprint100 QA Issues & TODOs

## 🐛 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### Issue #1: Multi-Player Race Support Missing
**Title**: Server only supports 2-player matches  
**Description**: The server architecture is limited to 2-player matches, preventing testing of 4-player and 8-player race scenarios. The core race mechanics (threshold logic, placement calculations) work correctly on the client side, but the server cannot handle multi-player races.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Attempt to create a 4-player race
2. Server only pairs 2 players at a time
3. No support for 4+ player lobbies

**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Label**: `bug`  
**Suggested Fix**: 
- Extend server to handle 4+ player races
- Add race state management for multiple players
- Implement multi-player match creation logic
- Add support for 4-player and 8-player lobbies

---

### Issue #2: Multi-Player ELO Calculations Missing
**Title**: ELO system only supports head-to-head matches  
**Description**: The ELO calculation system is designed for 2-player matches only. Multi-player races cannot calculate ELO changes, which is essential for competitive gameplay.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Create a 4-player race (if possible)
2. Complete the race
3. No ELO changes calculated for any player

**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Label**: `bug`  
**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement multi-player ELO calculation algorithm
- Add support for 4-player and 8-player ELO updates
- Extend ELO system to handle multiple opponents
- Add ELO calculation for different race sizes

### Issue #3: Match Disconnection Handling Missing
**Title**: Server has TODO comment for match disconnection  
**Description**: The server code contains a TODO comment for handling player disconnections during active matches. This causes race issues when players disconnect mid-race.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Start a 2-player race
2. One player disconnects mid-race
3. Server doesn't handle the disconnection properly
4. Race state becomes inconsistent

**Severity**: **HIGH**  
**Label**: `bug`  
**Suggested Fix**:
- Implement match disconnection handling in server
- Add DNF (Did Not Finish) status for disconnected players
- Implement race cancellation logic for disconnections
- Add proper cleanup for disconnected players

## ⚠️ High Priority Issues

### Issue #4: Rate Limiting Too Aggressive
**Title**: Rate limiting triggers after 5 registration attempts  
**Description**: The rate limiting system is too aggressive for testing scenarios, preventing the creation of multiple test accounts quickly.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Attempt to register 5+ test accounts
2. Rate limiting triggers after 5 attempts
3. Must wait 15 minutes between batches

**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Label**: `polish`  
**Suggested Fix**:
- Separate rate limits for registration vs login
- Allow higher limits for testing environments
- Add rate limit bypass for development
- Implement different limits for different endpoints

---

### Issue #5: Race State Persistence Missing
**Title**: Race progress lost on app restart  
**Description**: Race progress is not persisted on the server, so interrupted races cannot be resumed. This affects user experience during network issues or app crashes.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Start a race
2. Close the app or lose network connection
3. Reopen the app
4. Race progress is lost

**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Label**: `post-MVP`  
**Suggested Fix**:
- Store race progress in database
- Add race state persistence
- Implement race resumption logic
- Handle network interruptions gracefully

## 🔧 Medium Priority Issues

### Issue #6: No Reconnection Support
**Title**: Players cannot rejoin active races  
**Description**: If a player disconnects during a race, they cannot rejoin the active race. This creates a poor user experience for network interruptions.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Start a race
2. Player disconnects due to network issue
3. Player tries to reconnect
4. Cannot rejoin the active race

**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Label**: `post-MVP`  
**Suggested Fix**:
- Add reconnection support for active races
- Implement reconnection timeout logic
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Allow players to rejoin within time limit

---

### Issue #7: No Race Analytics
**Title**: Missing race statistics and performance metrics  
**Description**: The system lacks race analytics, making it difficult to monitor performance and track race statistics.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Complete several races
2. No race statistics available
3. No performance metrics tracked
4. No race replay functionality

**Severity**: **LOW**  
**Label**: `post-MVP`  
**Suggested Fix**:
- Add race statistics tracking
- Implement performance metrics monitoring
- Add race replay functionality
- Create analytics dashboard
